Functionality List- Console APP

Docs for this project:  

DONE:
 

CURRENT:
1. Make the console app ready to go for functions when you switch the keys and client id's. 
a. switch the keys section - this will just be a hardcode switch using creds file
b. Have another module that will have a class and then instances of the class that will be loaded from a yaml file 
by you just saying the name of the type of account. So a free account will be marked FREE and then what will be loaded
will be signature_request ID to implement functions that require that and also template for things that require templates.
c. this will all be designed for quick settings and use on the fly
d. this will be designed for quick reproduction of issues and also for quick demos 
 

TODO:

2. Automatically change test_mode=True if the account is a free account. Also, have a way to quickly set this all over 
the app with one flag

3. Have templates on each account that are uniform so that you do not have to spend anytime creating the uniform templates
ever again. Name them the same, and track the id's in the settings yaml file

4. Back up these yaml files somewhere that is safe to store them 

5.
