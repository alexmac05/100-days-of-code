Functionality List- Fax API Project

Docs for this project: https://faq.hellosign.com/hc/en-us/articles/216809878

DONE:
0. Create the basic Django Shell that will house the application calls and handle the callbacks. 
Issue #1 GitHubProject.  

1. Implement the most basic Callback handler for the FAX API Callback
https://github.com/alexmac05/onlinefaxmachine/issues/2

2. Create a creds.yml file that holds your API Key but is in the gitignore file.

3. Create a template for index so that you can have a button that when clicked fires off a method in the view. 
Label the button Account Information. And then show the results of the account information. 
The response will be a JSON representation of your account settings. Process that and display it to the end user. 

4. Translate the curl call that gets account information into an API call from this Django app. 
`curl -u"[your username]:[your password]" "https://api.hellofax.com/v1/Accounts/[Your Account GUID]"`

CURRENT:


5. Add a button to the front end to Update callback URLs. Accept a copy and paste from ngrok and hit the button and then have
the backend update the callback URL


TODO:


6. Add a button on the front end to Find out your fax lines for your account. Hit the button and get the fax lines. 
Display them to the user.

7. Add a button on the front end to display a list of area codes. Display that information.

8. Build functionality on the front end to upload a file to fax.

9. Send a fax. Get the 200 HTTP response. Verify you got a 200. From the front-end be able to indicate the To and From numbers.

10. Modify the callback handler to deal with all possible status codes that you can test for and then update the front-end with
a meaningful answer. 
 
11. Add functionality to purchance an additional fax line in an area code that is available.
